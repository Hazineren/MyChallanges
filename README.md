# MyChallanges

MyChallanges app is a modern ToDo app. The project I did to reinforce what I learned in the process up to a certain point in the React Native training I received through Patika contributed a lot to my understanding of the logic of the events. If the user has an account on the opening screen of the application, he logs in to his account. If he does not have an existing account, he will be directed to the 'Register' page for registration. 
After the user has successfully logged in, the job categories page greets the user. <br><br>
1) If the animals category is selected, the user can add new tasks for their pets from the 'Modal' window opened with the 'Add' button and delete them after the job is completed. At the same time, if he does not want to delete, he can inactivate the task with the 'Completed' button.<br>
2) If the Books category is selected, the user can add new reading tasks from the 'Modal' window opened with the 'Add' button, delete them after the task is completed, and update the remaining number of pages by entering the number of pages they have read with the 'Edit' button. At the same time, if he does not want to delete, he can disable the task with the 'Read' button.<br>
3) If the 'Home' category is selected, the user can tick the work he has done for each part of the house and mark it as completed. In the 'Home' tab; There are various sections such as kitchen, living room, garden. If the user ticks 'CheckBox', the number of housework on the 'Active job' page is reduced.<br>
4) By logging into the 'Plants' category, the user can keep the information about the last time she watered her plant with the 'Water' button.<br>
5) In the 'Game' category, I have listed the characteristics of the characters in the 'VALORANT' game, which is very popular today. The user can list the characters in the desired category by filtering them.(such as Duelist, Sentinel...)<br>
6) On the 'Bottom Tab', the user can go to the My Profile page and update her profile photo.<br>
7) At the same time, the user can access the 'Active Jobs' page on the 'Bottom Tab' and check how many active jobs are left in which category from a general point of view.<br>
